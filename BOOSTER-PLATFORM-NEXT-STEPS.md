# Booster Platform - Immediate Next Steps

## 🎯 STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION: Start → Expand → Replicate

Your template booster platform strategy is now fully documented and ready for implementation. Here's the immediate action plan:

---

## 🚀 WEEK 1: Foundation (Single Working File)

### Day 1-2: Figma Setup
**Create the first working file with minimal complexity**

✅ **Action Items:**
1. Login to Figma team account
2. Create file: "Windows Ad Kit - Base Pack v1"
3. Build ONE component set: "Base_Financing"
4. Create 4 variants: 1x1, 16x9, 4x5, 9x16
5. Set up component variables (text, colors, booleans)
6. Publish components and record IDs

**Environment Variables to Add:**
```env
# Base Pack - Start Simple
FIGMA_BASE_PACK_FILE_KEY="[FILE_KEY_FROM_URL]"
FIGMA_BASE_FINANCING_1x1_ID="[COMPONENT_ID]"
FIGMA_BASE_FINANCING_16x9_ID="[COMPONENT_ID]"
FIGMA_BASE_FINANCING_4x5_ID="[COMPONENT_ID]"
FIGMA_BASE_FINANCING_9x16_ID="[COMPONENT_ID]"
```

### Day 3-4: API Integration Test
**Prove the system works with real generation**

✅ **Test Script:**
```typescript
// Quick test with 4 components
const testGeneration = async () => {
  const formats = ['1x1', '16x9', '4x5', '9x16']
  
  for (const format of formats) {
    try {
      const result = await figmaService.generateAd({
        componentId: process.env[`FIGMA_BASE_FINANCING_${format.toUpperCase()}_ID`],
        businessName: "Test Windows Co",
        city: "Austin", 
        phone: "(512) 555-TEST"
      })
      
      console.log(`✅ ${format}: SUCCESS - ${result.exportUrl}`)
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`❌ ${format}: FAILED - ${error.message}`)
    }
  }
}
```

### Day 5: Customer Validation
**Test with real customer data**

✅ **Validation:**
- Generate ads for 1 existing customer
- Verify ads look professional and deployment-ready
- Test download process works
- Validate customer data populates correctly

---

## 📈 WEEK 2: Angle Expansion

### Day 1-3: Add 3 More Angles
**Expand same file with energy, speed, trust angles**

✅ **Add to Base Pack file:**
- Component Set: "Base_Energy" (4 variants)
- Component Set: "Base_Speed" (4 variants)  
- Component Set: "Base_Trust" (4 variants)
- Total: 16 components in one file

### Day 4-5: Strategic Integration
**Update generation logic for angle selection**

✅ **Code Updates:**
```typescript
// Dynamic angle-based generation
const generateCampaign = async (customerId, selectedAngles) => {
  const ads = []
  
  for (const angle of selectedAngles) {
    for (const format of ['1x1', '16x9', '4x5', '9x16']) {
      const componentId = process.env[`FIGMA_BASE_${angle.toUpperCase()}_${format.toUpperCase()}_ID`]
      
      const ad = await figmaService.generateAd({
        componentId,
        angle,
        format,
        businessData: customerData
      })
      
      ads.push(ad)
    }
  }
  
  return ads
}
```

## 🎨 WEEK 3: Template Variants

### Day 1-2: Add Conservative/Aggressive Variants
**Give customers choice within each angle**

✅ **Update Component Sets:**
```
Component Set: "Base_Financing" 
├── Properties:
│   ├── Format: 1x1, 16x9, 4x5, 9x16
│   └── Style: Conservative, Aggressive
├── Total Variants: 8 (4 formats × 2 styles)
```

### Day 3-4: Customer Selection Interface
**Enable template choice in UI**

✅ **Template Selection Page:**
- Show preview of conservative vs aggressive

- Use selection for generation

### Day 5: A/B Testing Setup
**Track which variants perform better**

✅ **Analytics:**
- Track variant usage by customer
- Monitor performance differences
- Collect customer feedback
- Optimize recommendations

## 📦 WEEK 4: Pack Replication

### Day 1-2: Create Second Pack
**Duplicate and customize for "Modern Style Pack"**

✅ **New Pack Creation:**
1. Duplicate "Base Pack" file → "Modern Style Pack v1"
2. Update design aesthetic (typography, colors, layout)
3. Publish new components with different IDs
4. Add to database as new template pack

### Day 3-4: Pack Management System  
**Build customer pack ownership**

✅ **Database & Logic:**
