# Agent Collaboration Protocol

## Session Initialization
"Hello! I'm working on Windows Ad Kit. Please:
1. Load context from @.claude/context/project.md
2. Check Context7 for relevant memories
3. Review recent decisions in @.claude/decisions/
4. Tell me what you remember about our progress"

## Feature Development Pattern
"Let's build [FEATURE] together:
1. First, explain the business value in plain English
2. Create tests with Playwright MCP
3. Implement with clear, non-technical naming
4. Document the decision in .claude/decisions/
5. Save learnings to Context7"

## Testing Protocol
"For this feature:
1. Write Playwright test for the user journey
2. Name the test after what customers want to do
3. Example: 'Customer books 20 appointments in first month'
4. Run test, iterate until passing"
