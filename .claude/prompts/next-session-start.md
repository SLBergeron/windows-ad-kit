# Windows Ad Kit - Next Session Startup

## üöÄ **AGENT COLLABORATION PROMPT**

```
Hello! I'm continuing Windows Ad Kit development. We just completed a major strategic breakthrough - Sprint 005: Real Creative Generation MVP + Template Booster Platform Strategy.

Please start by:
1. Loading context from @.claude/context/current-session-summary.md
2. Reviewing our strategic decision in @.claude/decisions/sprint-005-booster-platform-strategy.md  
3. Checking Context7 for Windows Ad Kit progress
4. Reading @BOOSTER-PLATFORM-NEXT-STEPS.md for immediate priorities

**CRITICAL CONTEXT**: We've transformed Windows Ad Kit from mock template delivery to real creative generation platform with a revolutionary Template Booster Platform business model that increases LTV by 172% ($295 ‚Üí $803).

**CURRENT STATUS**:
‚úÖ Sprint 005 architecture complete (Figma API integration, asset pipeline, quality assurance)
‚úÖ Template Booster Platform strategy designed (modular marketplace approach)
‚úÖ Progressive implementation roadmap created (4-week build ‚Üí expand ‚Üí replicate)
‚è≥ **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Week 1 Figma implementation (single working file foundation)

**TODAY'S MISSION**: Start Week 1 implementation - create "Windows Ad Kit - Base Pack v1" in Figma with real API integration that generates actual usable advertising campaigns for contractors.

What should we tackle first to make contractors successful with real creative automation?

## üîß **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**

### **Feature Development Pattern**
1. **Business Value First**: Always explain how this helps contractors succeed
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity only after validation

4. **Documentation**: Record decisions for future agent collaboration
5. **Performance Focus**: Measure contractor appointment booking success

### **Testing Protocol**
- Write Playwright tests for contractor user journeys
- Name tests after business outcomes ("contractor books 20 appointments")
- Test with real data and actual Figma API integration
- Validate end-to-end workflow from payment ‚Üí campaign deployment

### **Quality Standards**
- Professional output quality (80+ automated score)
- Real downloadable files ready for platform deployment
- Customer choice and control over creative direction
- Fallback systems for production reliability
