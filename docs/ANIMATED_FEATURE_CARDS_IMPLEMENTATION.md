### 🏗️ **Implementation Details**

**Component Architecture**
```typescript
// Feature card with full animation system
<AceternityFeatureCard
  icon="📝"
  title="Window & Door Ad Templates"
  description="Pre-built, proven Facebook ad templates..."
  included={true}
  upgrade={false}
/>
```

**Animation Features**
```typescript
// Icon animation with effects
const IconSkeleton = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const sequence = [
      [".icon-container", { scale: [1, 1.1, 1], rotate: [0, 5, -5, 0] }],
      [".icon-glow", { opacity: [0.3, 0.8, 0.3] }]
    ];
    animate(sequence, { repeat: Infinity, repeatDelay: 3 });
  }, []);
};

// Card hover animations
whileHover={{ 
  scale: 1.02,
  boxShadow: '0 25px 50px -12px rgba(255, 107, 107, 0.25)'
}}
```

**Visual Effects System**
```typescript
// Glowing background effects
background: 'radial-gradient(circle, rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.2) 0%, transparent 70%)'

// Floating particles
<motion.div animate={{ y: [0, -10, 0], opacity: [0, 1, 0] }} />

// Status badges with gradients
background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #10b981 0%, #059669 100%)'
```
