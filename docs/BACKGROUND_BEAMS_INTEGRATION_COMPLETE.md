## 🏗️ **Implementation Details**

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Clean integration within hero component
<AceternityHeroHighlight
  backgroundEffect="both"  // Aurora + Beams
/>

// Results in proper layering:
// 1. Aurora background (-4 z-index)
// 2. Background beams (-1 z-index)  
// 3. Hero content (1 z-index)
```

### File Structure Created

├── AceternityAurora.tsx          ✅ Existing aurora effect
└── index.ts                      ✅ Updated exports
```

### Background Effect Options
```typescript
backgroundEffect: 'aurora'  // Aurora only
backgroundEffect: 'beams'   // Beams only  
backgroundEffect: 'both'    // Aurora + Beams (current)
backgroundEffect: 'none'    // Clean hero section
```
