# Building [FEATURE NAME] Together

## Business Context
"Let's build [FEATURE]. First, explain to me:
1. How this helps Bob's Windows & Doors in Dallas
2. What success looks like in simple terms
3. How we measure if it's working"

## Implementation
"Now let's build it:
1. Create a Playwright test that describes success
2. Build the simplest version that passes the test
3. Use names that Bob would understand
4. Document what we learned"

## Validation
"Let's validate:
1. Run the test with Playwright MCP
2. Check if a non-technical person would understand
3. Save the pattern to Context7 for future features"
